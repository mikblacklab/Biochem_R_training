# Introduction

Interacting with databases through scripted languages can offer advantages over
querying databases via a GUI interface.  A GUI interface for your database is
easier to use and allows the quick viewing of adhoc queries.  Querying a
database with a programatic interface (in this case R, but it could be any
language) are slightly more complicated.  However the trade-off is that data
manipulations are preserved in the code.  Aggregations, summaries and other
database operations are preserved.  Therefore those pre-analysis data
manipulation steps are not lost and can be reproduced later by yourself or
others.

# Connecting R to sqlite databases

R can connect to databases through a number of packages.  In our case we we will
use [RSQLite](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html) to
connect to existing SQLite3 databases.  However you should be able to connect on
almost any database in R via
JDBC[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDBC/index.html](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDBC/index.html)
or [ODBC](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html), or specific
database packages (such as we are doing, or
[MySQL](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html) ).

To begin these exercises we'll connect to the mammal database you've just
created. We'll need the RSQLite library to be sure to install it
first. `install.packages('RSQLite')`.

```{r connect, purl=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
## Set dbname and driver out of convenience
myDB <- "data/portal_mammals.sqlite"
conn <- dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), dbname= myDB)
```

Now we're connected to our database, let's explore the table structure in the
database.  Remember we could see the list of tables in the SQLite Firefox
gui. In R, we'll need to use SQL commands.

Running SQL queries from R
----
We can view information about the database structure which includes a list of all tables like this:

```{r Get Table information, eval=FALSE}
dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT type, tbl_name  FROM sqlite_master")
```

The `RSQLite` library also has functions that can be used to list both tables
and fields within a table. Here you can see the types and names of fields and
get a count of records.

```{r table details, purl=FALSE}
dbListTables(conn)
#get list of fields in the surveys table
dbListFields(conn,"surveys")
dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT count(*) FROM surveys")
```

It's good practice to always close a connection that you open in R. Let's do that next.
Note that once you've closed a connection, you will have to open a new connection to
query and import the data again.

```{r close Connection}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

We've now covered the basics of connecting to a database and exploring its basic
structure. From here we can write queries to access subsets of the data within
our database, using the same methods that we used in SQLite.

Let's try some basic queries from the previous lesson.  Querying simply takes a
connection to a database and query as inputs and returns a dataframe with the
results.

Before we can do this, we need to re-establish a database connection.

```{r reconnect}
library(RSQLite)
## Set dbname and driver out of convenience
myDB <- "data/portal_mammals.sqlite"
conn <- dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), dbname= myDB)
```

Next, we build our query. We can use the `dbGetQuery` function to run the query
and access data returned in a `data.frame` object.


```{r basic queries, purl=FALSE}
q <- 'SELECT DISTINCT year, species_id FROM surveys'
result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, q)
head(result)
```


> ## Challenge
>
>  1. Write a query that returns counts of genus by plot_id
>  2. You can join multiple tables together in SQL using the following syntax where foreign key refers to your unique id (eg species_id):
 SELECT table.col, table.col
 FROM table1 JOIN table2
 ON table1.key = table2.key
 JOIN table3 ON table2.key = table3.key

> Write a query that joins the species, plot and survey tables together. The query should return counts of genus by plot type. Then create a bar plot of your results in R.


```{r genus by type, purl=FALSE}
q <- "SELECT d.plot_type , c.genus, count(*)
FROM
(SELECT a.genus, b.plot
FROM species a
JOIN surveys b
ON a.species_id = b.species_id) c
JOIN plots d
ON c.plot = d.plot_id
GROUP BY d.plot_type,c.genus"

result <- dbGetQuery(conn,q)
head(result)

```

All we've done so far is execute the same sorts of queries that can easily be
made with a GUI.  Now let's try leveraging the power of scripted queries.
Imagine you want to know how many rodents were found every other year.  To get
this we'll get the range of dates from the database, sequence them by two and
make new queries.

```{r Get years of data, purl=FALSE}
yearRange <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT min(year),max(year) FROM surveys")
years <- seq(yearRange[,1],yearRange[,2],by=2)
```

Next we'll build our query string using the `paste()` function.

```{r creating query, purl=FALSE}
q <- paste("
SELECT a.year,b.taxa,count(*) as count
FROM surveys a
JOIN species b
ON a.species_id = b.species_id
AND b.taxa = 'Rodent'
AND a.year in (",
paste(years,collapse=",")
,")
GROUP BY a.year, b.taxa",
sep = "" )
rCount <- dbGetQuery(conn,q)
head(rCount)
```

With the nested paste commands we were able to construct a query
programatically, without having to type out all the years.  This could also be
done with a for loop, especially if the query to be constructed is more
complicated.

Creating a SQLite DB using R
------

We can use R to create a new database and associated structure (also known as
the schema) databases from existing `csv` files.  Let's recreate the mammals
database that we've been working with, in R. First let's read in the `csv`
files.

Up until now we been working with an existing data. However we can use R as a
way to build up databases from existing flat files.  We'll use the flat files
that make up the mammals database to recreate it.  First let's read in the
files.

```{r Generate a dataframe, purl=FALSE}
species <- read.csv("data/species.csv")
surveys <- read.csv("data/surveys.csv")
plots <- read.csv("data/plots.csv")
```

Next we'll need to create a database and add our tables.

```{r create database, purl=FALSE}
myDB <- "portalR.db"
myConn <- dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), dbname= myDB)
dbListTables(myConn)
```

By opening up a connection, you've created a new database.  If you list the
tables you'll see that the database is empty. Next we'll add the dataframes we
just read in to the database.

```{r add data, purl=FALSE}
dbWriteTable(myConn,"species",species)
dbListTables(myConn)
dbGetQuery(myConn,"SELECT * from species limit 10")
```

If you check the location of our database you'll see that data is automatically
being written to disk. Not only does R and RSQLite provide easy ways to query
existing databases, it also allows you to easily create your own databases from
flat files.

> ## Challenge
>
> Add the remaining tables to the existing database. Open the new database using the Firefox SQLite manager to verify that the database was built successfully.


> ## Extra Challenge
>
> Run some of your queries from earlier in the lesson to verify that you have faithfully recreated the mammals database.

Don't forget to close your database connection when you are done with it!
