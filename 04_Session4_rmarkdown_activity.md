## Getting started with Rmarkdown

Create your first Rmarkdown document:

 - In RStudio, select "New File" from the "File" menu and then choose
"R Markdown..."

 - Choose "Document" in the window that opens, give it a title, and 
click "OK".

This will open a new file in RStudio.  The file is written in Rmarkdown, 
and contains a mix of text and code.

 - The text has some formatting applied (e.g., \*\*this is bold\*\* 
renders as **this is bold**), and the code is surrounding by tick marks:
\`\`\`.
